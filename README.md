# PH Tax Calculator

This is a mini-project to compute monthly net income of an employee working in the Philippines.
All calculations are updated as of March 2025 with references linked below:

- [SSS Employee Contribution](https://www.sss.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cir-2024-006-Employers-scaled.jpg)
- [PhilHealth Contribution Table as per PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-0009](https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/partners/employers/ContributionTable_v2.pdf)
- [HDMF/Pag-IBIG Contribution Table for 2024](https://mpm.ph/hdmf-pag-ibig-table-2024/)

### Dev Note

Using Next.js / React is kinda an overkill (only did so to familiarize myself with Next App Route).
Also, I might add more calculators in the future. :)
