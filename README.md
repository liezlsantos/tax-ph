# PH Tax Calculator 2024

This is a mini-project to compute monthly net income of an employee working in the Philippines.
All calculations are updated as of April 2024 with references linked below:

- [SSS Employee Contribution](https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/DownloadContent?fileName=2023-Schedule-of-Contributions.pdf)
- [PhilHealth Contribution Table as per PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-0009](https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/partners/employers/ContributionTable_v2.pdf)
- [HDMF/Pag-IBIG Contribution Table for 2024](https://mpm.ph/hdmf-pag-ibig-table-2024/)

### Dev note
Using Next.js / React is kinda an overkill (only did so to familiarize myself with Next App Route).
Also, I might add more calculators in the future. :)
